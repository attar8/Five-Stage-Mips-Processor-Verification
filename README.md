# Five-Stage-Mips-Processor-Verification
The MIPS processor this project intends to verify is a 16 bit, 5 staged pipelined processor. It provides 16 instructions with 49 variants. This verification process of this design involves first verifying individual blocks of each stage and then verifying the overall working of the design.

 Although this remains a two-step process this is done by automating the verification process and making use of only one testing system which has interfaces to all the internal blocks as well as the main input-output blocks. By this process, the verification can be highly automated, high-speed and accurate![image](https://github.com/attar8/Five-Stage-Mips-Processor-Verification/assets/87374356/4f2d1843-8b1d-49b1-992f-85c9bfb78bd7)
